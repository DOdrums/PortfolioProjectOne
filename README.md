## Credits

To be able to build this project in gitpod, I used the template made by Code Institute, as found here: [full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

Other websites I used for inspiration and general coding examples and knowledge:
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)
* 

### Code
* Nav bar inspiration was taken from the love running walkthrough project
* The code `margin-left: calc((100% - 600px) / 2);` to center paragraphs on page 2 and 3 was taken from the NYtimes website, which uses this code to center text in their articles

## Bugs
* After finishing page 2 of the website, I noticed that the line underneath the nav bar was suddenly cut in half. This was caused by a bottom-margin property being added to the main font selector (which includes the nav element). This was solved by making a selector that contains a negative bottom-margin to the ul and il child elements of the nav element and by adding a nav selector that contains a bottom-margin of 0.
* The thumbnail of the youtube video would dissapear in and out of frame partially when resizing the window. After some playing around in the chrome dev tools, I discovered this was due to the width being set to a percentage setting instead of pixels. I changed it to pixels and now the thumbnail stayed sized the same no matter the window size.
* There was a problem with the hero image after resizing it to fit tablet sizes. The hero image was now zooming into the div below instead of behind it. This was because I changed the height setting of hero-image id but not of the hero-outer id.
