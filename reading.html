                    <p class="intro-text">A big part of playing big band music well, comes down to being a good reader. Most big band drummers are exceptional readers. However, reading a drum sheet isn't simply playing the notes that are written down, it's all about interpreting those notes. Since this resource is meant for experienced drummers and conductors, it is expected you already know the basics of how to read sheet music.</p>

                    The piece pictured below is a snippet of the song 'Basie - Straight Ahead' as played by the 'Count Basie Orchestra'. It's a medium-up swing tune, with very loud tutti sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any swing piece, the drummer will play a basic swing pattern on ride cymbal and hi-hat on beat 2 and 4. Sometimes the bass drum is “feathered”, meaning it will play very softly on each beat, to create more momentum in the groove. Unless told otherwise, the drummer will continue doing this.

                    In this piece, you can see a few rhythms written out, which will be the moment for the drummer to break up his swing pattern and start filling and playing along with the horn sections. Have a look at the circled section at the end of the piece, and see how those notes differ from the rest. Both the notes in and above the staff represent rhythms that are played by the horns, or the rhythm section. However, the rhythms written above the staff will usually be played with less emphasis than the rhythms above the staff. It is your job as a big band drummer to interpret how best to play the notes, in order to make the big band sound good.

                <p>
                    Look at the piece below, which is a snippet of Count Basie's 'All Of Me'. A famous performance, from the album 'Live At The Sands Hotel'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sonny Payne plays the drums on this entire album, and he perfectly interprets the notes on the paper. Notice that in this snippet, all the notes are written above the staff.

                    Listen to the audio example below and note how Payne mostly continues his time playing and only accentuates the accents with his base drum, preceded by short fills on his snare drum, probably played with his left hand, since the time-keeping continues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pause the music once you reach the end of the sheet.

                    Besides writing horn notes above the staff, it's also common to write notes inside the staff. This indicates you should play the notes with more emphasis. Have a look at the sheet below, to see what that looks like.

                    As you can see, not only are the notes written in side the staff, it also reads 'Loud Orch.' above the staff, which tells you it will be a particularly loud section. So, you should play this part with loudly and with emphasis and you'll probably want to play a fill leading up to the horn accents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Resume the audio clip and listen how Sonny Payne plays this section.

                    It's important to note that the quality and way of writing drum sheets can be entirely dependent on who is the arranger. As you can see, I scribbled some notes into the sheet, for clarification. This is standard practice, as the arranger usually choses not to overcrowd the sheet, so the drummer can make their own decisions on how to play the piece. During a rehearsal, you should find yourself writing notes often.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the notes in this second section could have been written inside the staff, to make it more clear they should be played forcefully. Getting skilled at deciphering big band drum sheets is a matter of experience and the more you'll do it, the more you'll find yourself making correct guesses as to how a piece should be played.

                    Best Practices

                <p>
                    Let's establish a few “rules” (best practices), to create some guidelines on how to play accents and how to lead the band into an accent. For this, we'll use Basie's 'Get Me To The Church On Time', again from the 'Live At The Sands Hotel' album. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    How a drummer plays accents and fills in big band music is quite personal, however, you can find similarities between many different drummers. Let's use these similarities as a sort of “rule book” for playing big band music. Remember that exceptions are many and as a drummer, you should always develop your own style. These rules are here as a tool and guide, not to follow religiously.
                </p>
                <p>Take a look at the sheet below, listen to the music and notice the ways in which the accents and fills are being played. Now read through the 'horn accents' and 'fills' bullet points and give the track another listen.</p>
