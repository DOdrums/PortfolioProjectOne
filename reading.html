                <p class="intro-text">A big part of playing big band music well, comes down to being a good reader. Most big band drummers are exceptional readers. However, reading a drum sheet isn't simply playing the notes that are written down, it's all about interpreting those notes. Since this resource is meant for experienced drummers and conductors, it is expected you already know the basics of how to read sheet music. Look at the example below:</p>

                <p>The piece pictured above is a snippet of the song 'Basie - Straight Ahead' as played by the 'Count Basie Orchestra'. It's a medium-up swing tune, with very loud tutti sections. In any swing piece, the drummer will play a basic swing pattern on ride cymbal and hi-hat on beat 2 and 4. Sometimes the bass drum is “feathered”, meaning it will play very softly on each beat, to create more momentum in the groove. Unless told otherwise, the drummer will continue doing this. In the piece above, you can see a few rhythms written out, which will be the moment for the drummer to break up his swing pattern and start filling and playing along with the horn sections. Have a look at the circled section at the end of the piece, and see how those notes differ from the rest. Both the notes in and above the staff represent rhythms that are played by the horns, or the rhythm section. However, the rhythms written above the staff will usually be played with less emphasis than the rhythms above the staff. It is your job as a big band drummer to interpret how best to play the notes, in order to make the big band sound good. </p>
