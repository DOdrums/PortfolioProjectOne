                        well, comes down to being a good reader. Most big band
                        drummers are exceptional readers. However, reading a
                        drum sheet isn't simply playing the notes that are
                        written down, it's all about interpreting those notes.
                        Since this resource is meant for experienced drummers
                        and conductors, it is expected you already know the
                        basics of how to read sheet music.</p>

                <p>
                    The piece pictured below is a snippet of the song 'Basie -
                    Straight Ahead' as played by the 'Count Basie Orchestra'.
                    It's a medium-up swing tune, with very loud tutti sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any swing piece, the drummer will play a basic swing
                    pattern on ride cymbal and hi-hat on beat 2 and 4. Sometimes
                    the bass drum is “feathered”, meaning it will play very
                    softly on each beat, to create more momentum in the groove.
                    Unless told otherwise, the drummer will continue doing this.

                    In this piece, you can see a few rhythms written out, which
                    will be the moment for the drummer to break up his swing
                    pattern and start filling and playing along with the horn
                    sections. Have a look at the circled section at the end of
                    the piece, and see how those notes differ from the rest.
                    Both the notes in and above the staff represent rhythms that
                    are played by the horns, or the rhythm section. However, the
                    rhythms written above the staff will usually be played with
                    less emphasis than the rhythms inside the staff. It is your
                    job as a big band drummer to interpret how best to play the
                    notes, in order to make the big band sound good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at the piece below, which is a snippet of Count Basie's
                    'All Of Me'. A famous performance, from the album 'Live At
                    The Sands Hotel'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sonny Payne plays the drums on this entire album, and he
                    perfectly interprets the notes on the paper. Notice that in
                    this snippet, all the notes are written above the staff.

                    Listen to the audio example below and note how Payne mostly
                    continues his time playing and only accentuates the accents
                    with his base drum, preceded by short fills on his snare
                    drum (probably played with his left hand, since the
                    time-keeping continues).

                    Besides writing horn notes above the staff, it's also common
                    to write notes inside the staff. This indicates you should
                    play the notes with more emphasis. Have a look at the sheet
                    below, to see what that looks like.

                    As you can see, not only are the notes written inside the
                    staff, it also reads 'Loud Orch.' above the staff, which
                    tells you it will be a particularly loud section. So, you
                    should play this part loudly and with emphasis and you'll
                    probably want to play a fill leading up to the horn accents.

                <p>
                    Resume the audio clip and listen how Sonny Payne plays this

                    It's important to note that the quality and way of writing
                    drum sheets can be entirely dependent on who the arranger
                    is. As you can see, I scribbled some notes into the sheet,
                    for clarification. This is standard practice, as the
                    arranger usually choses not to overcrowd the sheet, so the
                    drummer can make their own decisions on how to play the
                    piece. During a rehearsal, you should find yourself writing
                    often.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the notes in this second section could have been
                    written inside the staff, to make it more clear they should
                    be played with force. Getting skilled at deciphering big
                    band drum sheets is a matter of experience and the more
                    you'll do it, the more you'll find yourself making correct
                    guesses as to how a piece should be played.

                    Best Practices
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's establish a few “rules” (best practices), to create
                    some guidelines on how to play accents and how to lead the
                    band into an accent. For this, we'll use Basie's 'Get Me To
                    The Church On Time', again from the 'Live At The Sands
                    Hotel' album.

                <p>
                    How a drummer plays accents and fills in big band music is
                    quite personal, however, you can find similarities between
                    many different drummers. Let's use these similarities as a
                    sort of “rule book” for playing big band music. Remember
                    that exceptions are many and as a drummer, you should always
                    develop your own style. These rules are meant as a tool and
                    guide, not to be followed religiously.
                </p>
                <p>Take a look at the sheet below, listen to the music and
                    notice the ways in which the accents and fills are being
                    played. Now read through the 'Horn Accents' and 'Fills'
                    bullet points and give the track another listen.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Use of base drum + crash/ride cymbal when accompanying

                    </li>
                    <li>Always listen to the melody to decide how best to play
                        the accents.</li>
                    <li>Always listen to the timbre of the horn players to
                        decide how best to play the accents (trombone accents
                        often work well with base drum, trumpet accents tend to
                        sound nice on snare drum).</li>

                    <li>Play shorter accents on snare drum and crash/ride cymbal
                        or snare and (half-open) hi-hat.</li>
                    <li>Play longer accents on base drum and crash/ride cymbal.

                    <li>Listenening to the timbre of the horns is extra
                        important at soft volumes.</li>
                    <li>Keep the time on your ride going steady, since soft

                <h3>Fills</h3>
                <!-- fills section -->
                <p>With fills it's less clearcut, because if there is one domain
                    where a drummer can show their own style, it's in their
                    fills. This means that for the most part, you should just
                    find your own style in playing fills! To help you along,
                    here are a few tips and general conventions in playing
                    fills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It works well to have a contrasting sound between the
                        fill and the accent. If you plan on playing an accent on
                        snare drum, it sounds good to finish the fill on a low
                        sounding drum like the base drum or floor tom (and vice
                        versa).</li>

                        Fills can be used to dictate the timing/feel of (strings
                        of) accents, so experiment with playing fills in a way
                        that will already suggest the feel of the notes to come.

                        In some scenario's it can also work well to play a
                        contrasting rhythm (to the rhythm of the accent), but
                        only do this when you are absolutely certain it won't
                        confuse the horn players.

                <p>For both accents and fills, the number one tip and rule you
                    should always follow: listen to the greats! A lot of playing
                    done by the most well known big band drummers is great not
                    because of the technical skill, but because they know when
                    to play, what to play and why they play it! Check out the <a
                        href="three-drummers.html">Three Drummers</a> section to
                    get some great listening examples.
