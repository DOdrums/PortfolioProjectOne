           This website is build to hopefully be a valuable resource for drummers and conductors, to build a better understanding of what big band drumming 
           looks, sound and feels like. Since it's build as part of a software development course, it will not contain all the knowledge I could share about the subject, 
           but I might expand on it at a later date.
