                This website is build to hopefully be a valuable resource for drummers and conductors, to build a better understanding of what big band drumming looks, sounds and feels like. Since it's build as part of a software development course, it will not contain all the knowledge I could share on this subject, but I might expand on it at a later date.

                <p>For the past ten years, I have been a professional musician, making a living playing gigs and teaching drums. Though I like and play many different styles, one of my specialities is big band music. When I was 13 years old, I joined the music school big band of my town and I haven't stopped playing in big bands ever since. During my conservatories studies I spent a considerable amount of my time studying the big band greats and big band music in general. On this website I'll share what I've learned from personal experience and from others. It's important to note that a lot of this comes down to interpretation and many “rules” are not written in stone! Develop your own style and use this website as a tool, not as a manual.</p>
