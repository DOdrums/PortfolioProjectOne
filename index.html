            This website is built to hopefully be a valuable resource for
            drummers and conductors, to built a better understanding of what big
            band drumming looks, sounds and feels like. Since it's build as part
            of a software development course, it will not contain all the
            knowledge I could share on this subject, but I might expand on it at
            a later date.

                </div>
                <p class="intro-text bold">For the past ten years, I have been a
                    professional musician, making a living playing gigs and
                    teaching drums. Though I like and play many different
                    styles, one of my specialities is big band music. When I was
                    13 years old, I joined the music school big band of my town
                    and I haven't stopped playing in big bands ever since! On
                    this website I'll share what I've learned from personal
                    experience and from others. Note that a lot of this comes
                    down to interpretation and many “rules” are not written in
                    stone! Develop your own style and use this website as a
                    tool, not as a manual.</p>
