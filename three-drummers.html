There are a good many jazz and big band drummers that could play a roll in the development of your style, but these three drummers personally had a big impact on how I approach big band playing. It is encouraged to listen to many different big bands and drummers, to get a broad profile of the big band drummer.</p>

                    We'll start off this section with Mel Lewis, a drummer with a very particular sound. Known for his work with the 'Mel Lewis/Thad Jones Orchestra', he has an amazing track record, playing with many of the greats in jazz music.

                <p>
                    Mel Lewis was unique in his big band playing, heaving a very relaxed sound and playing almost exclusively at softer volumes. In the book 'The View From The Back Of The Band' (a biography of Mel Lewis), he is quoted having a conversation with Stan Kenton:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-box">
               <p>"When I joined Kenton, that very first night, he came over and yelled, 'Hey Mel, can you play louder?' And I said, 'No'. He said, 'Okay, I just thought I'd ask'."</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="article-box">
                <p>Mel said he never felt it was necessary to play loud, but don't let that fool you, his playing was very dynamic. He knew how to create tension and play with energy, without overwelming the band. In his own big band, the Mel Lewis/Thad Jones Orchestra, this very much defined their sound.</p>
                <p>In keeping with his relaxed style, Mel played behind the beat. Compared to the examples we listened to on the previous page, from the Count Basie big band, there is a noticable difference in Mel's drive, albeit only slightly. His time keeping lays a bit more behind the beat than that of Sonny Payne, but he is still able to keep a clear drive.</p>
                <p>Another thing that stands out in Mel's playing is his tendency to play melodically. This means, that not only does he play a melodic fill to lead into the accent, he will also play along with the accent, mimicking the time and feel of the melody played by the horns.</p>
                <p>A short note on his drum set: Mel played exclusively on Gretch drums, which had a warm and rich sound. His cymbals were Istanbuls, with a 21 inch and 19 inch crash/ride and the famous swish knocker (a thin china cymbal with rivets in the edges). His cymbals had a dark sound with plenty of wash, a sound signature loved by many jazz drummers.</p>
                <p>Listen to 'A-That's Freedom' by the 'Mel Lewis/Thad Jones Orchestra' now, to get a good example of his playing:</p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next on the list is Butch Miles. This drummer could arguably be Mel Lewis' counterpart. A drummer known for his loud and explosive playing, Butch Miles is a very different sounding drummer from Mel Lewis.

            <div class="article-box">
                <p>Where Mel Lewis uses flow as his weapon of choice, for Butch Miles it would be contrast. He loves playing very loud and sudden fills, that seem to come out of nowhere. The accent that follows is played loudly and clearly, often on snare drum.</p>
                <p>Butch tends to break up his time a lot as well, playing loud crash cymbals and base drums along with accents or even in between accents. Compare this to Mel Lewis who loves to play his fills in a very flowy feeling, often incorparating his swinging ride in his fills. Butch Miles' tendency to use his base drum to seperate loud accents creates very energetic sections which seem to have explosions of energy coming out of his drum kit and the band.</p>
                <p>Butch's drum set was usually a Ludwig. It sounds a bit more open and less warm than Mel Lewis' Gretsch, but is still considered a warm soundig kit overall. Also Miles' cymbals (Zildjians) are slightly more 'pingy' and have less wash than the Istanbuls used by Lewis. The biggest difference in sound however, is how Miles tunes his snare drum. It's a higher pitched snare drum, which makes it easier to cut through the band.</p>
                <p>Since Butch Miles' playing is so explosive, it is only fitting he plays with the Count Basie Big Band, one of the loudest big bands out there. Have a listen to the track 'Splanky' as played by Butch Miles with the Count Basie Big Band:</p>

                <p>The final drummer we will listen to is Sonny Payne. You might recognize his name from the Reading & Playing page, where a picture of him can be found on the top of the page. You have also been listening to his playing in all of the audio examples in the Reading & Playing page. Let's dive into why that is!</p>

                <p>Sonny Payne has a great track record with Count Basie, having played with his big band for over 10 years. Initally send to Basie's band as a sub, as soon as Basie heard him play, he knew he had to hire him, stating that Sonny Payne brought a new spark to the band.</p>
                <p>Butch Miles also talks highly of Sonny Payne, stating in a 1975 interview:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>"I took a lot of my cues and a lot of my drumming style from Sonny Payne. When i first joined the band I knew, I knew everything that he had played, so we'd get to a certain point, I'd just play what Sonny had played and it worked. I memorized all of Sonny Payne's licks. I tried 'em, and the worked."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article-box">
                <p>The reason I picked Sonny Payne as third drummer, and used his recordings for the Reading & Playing page, is that he falls in between Mel Lewis and Butch Miles in terms of sound and playing style. Payne had a more relaxed style than Miles, but defenitely played with more aggresion and volume than Lewis. His kit was a Gretsch, just like Lewis had, but he tuned it higher, like Miles did. His cymbals were bright, but with more wash than Miles' cymbals.</p>
                <p>One thing Payne knew how to do perfectly, was create that explosive Basie sound, without interrupting the beat to much. Playing loud fills on snare drum and hit accents full force, but using the base drum sparcsely, so the time keeps flowing.</p>
                <p>Give the audio track below a listen, it's another recording of 'Splanky' by the 'Count Basie Big Band', but this time with Sonny Payne behind the drums. Notice how the track seems more flowy and Payne's drumming is less disruptive. Compare this recording to the previous recording of 'Splanky' and listen to the diffence in snare drum and base drum usage and how fills are played differently. Of course this recording is also played in a slower tempo, but Payne's playing would have given it a more flowy and relaxed feel regardless.
