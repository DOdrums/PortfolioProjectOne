There are a good many jazz and big band drummers that could play a roll in the development of your style, but these three drummers personally had a big impact on how I approach big band playing. It is encouraged to listen to many different big bands and drummers, to get a broad profile of the big band drummer.</p>

                    We'll start off this section with Mel Lewis, a drummer with a very particular sound. Known for his work with the 'Mel Lewis/Thad Jones Orchestra', he has an amazing track record, playing with many of the greats in jazz music.

                    Mel Lewis was unique in his big band playing, heaving a very relaxed sound and playing almost exclusively at softer volumes. In the book 'The View From The Back Of The Band' (a biography of Mel Lewis), he is quoted having a conversation with Stan Kenton:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="quote-box">
               <p>"When I joined Kenton, that very first night, he came over and yelled, 'Hey Mel, can you play louder?' And I said, 'No'. He said, 'Okay, I just thought I'd ask'."</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="article-box">
                <p>Mel said he never felt it was necessary to play loud, but don't let that fool you, his playing was very dynamic. He knew how to create tension and play with energy, without overwelming the band. In his own big band, the Mel Lewis/Thad Jones Orchestra, this very much defined their sound.</p>
                <p>In keeping with this relaxed style, Mel Played behind the beat. Compared to the examples we listened to on the previous page, from the Count Basie big band, there is a noticable difference in Mel's drive, albeit only slightly. His time keeping is slightly more behind the beat than that of Sonny Payne, but still with a clear drive.</p>
                <p>Another thing that stands out in Mel's playing is his tendency to play melodically. This means, that not only does he play a melodic fill to lead into the accent, he will also play along with the accent, mimicking the time and feel of the melody played by the horns.</p>
                <p>Listen to 'A-That's Freedom' by the 'Mel Lewis/Thad Jones Orchestra' now, to get a good example of his playing:</p>

                    Butch Miles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next on the list is Butch Miles. This drummer could arguably be Mel Lewis' counterpart. A drummer known for his loud and explosive playing, Butch Miles is a very different sounding drummer than Mel Lewis.

                <p>Where Mel Lewis uses flow as his weapon of choice, for Butch Miles it would be contrast. He loves playing very loud and sudden fills, that seem to come out of nowhere. The accent that follows is played loudly and clearly, often on snare drum.</p>
                <p>Butch tends to break up his time a lot as well, compared to Mel Lewis who loves to play his fills in a very flowy feeling, often incorparating his swinging ride in his fills. When Butch Miles wants to make an impact, he often uses his base drum, to really seperate what he is playing from the beat. This created very energetic sections which seem to have explosions of energy coming out of his drum kit and the band.</p>
                <p>Since Butch Miles' playing is so explosive, it is only fitting he plays with the Count Basie Big Band, one of the loudest big bands out there. Have a listen to the track 'Splanky' as played by Butch Miles with the Count Basie Big Band:</p>
